## Hey 👋 there, I am Fahim Mohamed

Formerly as Ethereum Security Researcher, I currently enjoy learning, researching and building Zero Knowledge Proof Systems. Having taken Bsc in Energy Engineering, i decided to deploy my love for Mathematics & Physics and wrap them together into Blockchain systems particularly solving the issues of Scalability and Privacy.

For those who do not know Zero Knowledge Proofs, this are systems that use mathematical rules to authentically prove a secretive content or element without revealing it.
